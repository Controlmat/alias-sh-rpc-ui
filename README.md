# Shell-UI for [Spectrecoin](https://spectreproject.io) daemon

This is a Shell script (in fact a Bash script) which offers a simple
user interface to the Spectrecoin daemon.

Make sure the RPC login info matches the "spectrecoin.conf" settings.

In case you didn't have such .conf file, there is an example placed
in the dir "sample_config_daemon".

More documentation soon...
