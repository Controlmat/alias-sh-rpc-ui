# Shell-UI for [Spectrecoin](https://spectreproject.io) daemon

This is a Shell script (in fact a Bash script) which offers a simple
user interface to the Spectrecoin daemon.

Configuration file for Spectrecoin daemon is automatically created during first start.
Please stop daemon if you want to make changes afterwards.

More documentation soon...
