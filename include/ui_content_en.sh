# Set global variables for text output(i.e. for main menu).
#
# Interpret embedded "\Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character,
# which tells dialog to set colors or video attributes: 0 through 7 are the ANSI
# used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.
# Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.
# Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.
# Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.
# The settings are cumulative,
# e.g., "\Zb\Z1" makes the following text bold (perhaps bright) red.
# Restore normal settings with "\Zn".
